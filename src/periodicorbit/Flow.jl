# Structures related to computing ODE/PDE Flows
"""
$(TYPEDEF)

Structure to encode the flow associated to a Cauchy problem `dx/dt = F(x, p)`.

$(TYPEDFIELDS)

# Simplified constructor(s)
We provide a simple constructor where you only pass the vector field `F`, the flow `ϕ` and its differential `dϕ`:

    fl = Flow(F, ϕ, dϕ)

# Simplified constructors for DifferentialEquations.jl

These are some simple constructors for which you only have to pass a `prob::ODEProblem` or `prob::EnsembleProblem` (for parallel computation) from `DifferentialEquations.jl` and an ODE time stepper like `Tsit5()`. Hence, you can do for example

    fl = Flow(prob, Tsit5(); kwargs...)

where `kwargs` is passed to `SciMLBase::solve`. If your vector field depends on parameters `p`, you can define a `Flow` using

    fl = Flow(prob, Tsit5(); kwargs...)

Finally, you can pass two `ODEProblem` where the second one is used to compute the variational equation:

    fl = Flow(prob1::ODEProblem, alg1, prob2::ODEProblem, alg2; kwargs...)
